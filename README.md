🔥 A Quadruped Robot for Security Patrol Support
Describe project: This is my graduation project, which is a smart mobile quadruped robot with 12 degrees of freedom (DOF). The robot is capable of coordinated movement and dynamic balancing using the MPU6050 sensor, allowing it to walk and maintain stability even on inclined or uneven terrain.
Teamsize: 3 
Person: I developed a control application using JavaScript with Socket.IO for real-time remote control and monitoring and the system includes a camera for remote supervision on Web and I programmed the coordination between the servos to move the robot.
